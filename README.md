On the titanic data set, the notebook does exploratory data analysis. The data set was obtained from the kaggle website. 

The notebook made use of several packages.
The following packages are used:

### numpy & pandas
### matplotlib & seaborn
The first two packages deal with computing and data analysis, while the other two deal with data visualization.

Three critical steps to follow in this EDA are :

####  1- Understand the data

####  2- Clean the data

####  3- Discover a relationship between variables.

In this project I have successfully:

####  * Loaded our data and had a look at it.
####  * Explored our target variable visually and made your first predictions.
####  * Explored some of our feature variables visually and made more predictions that did better based on our EDA.
####  * Done some serious EDA of feature variables, categorical and numeric.
